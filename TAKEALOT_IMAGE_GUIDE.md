# 🛒 Takealot Product Image Download Guide

## 🎯 What This Does
This guide helps you download high-quality product images from Takealot and update your database with them.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Your backend server running
- Takealot product URLs for the products you want

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Find Takealot Product URLs
1. Go to [Takealot.com](https://www.takealot.com)
2. Search for the products you want images for
3. Copy the product page URLs
4. Update the `takealotProducts` array in `scripts/downloadTakealotImages.js`

### Step 2: Download Images
```bash
cd /home/nickimash17/techshop-pro
node scripts/downloadTakealotImages.js
```

This will:
- Extract product images from Takealot pages
- Download them to `public/product-images/`
- Show you the web URLs to use

### Step 3: Update Database
```bash
cd /home/nickimash17/techshop-pro/backend
node scripts/updateDatabaseWithLocalImages.js
```

This will:
- Update your database with the new image URLs
- Show you which products were updated

### Step 4: Serve Images
You have two options:

#### Option A: Serve from Public Folder
- Images are already in `public/product-images/`
- Your backend can serve them directly
- URLs will be like: `http://localhost:3001/product-images/iphone-15-pro-max.jpg`

#### Option B: Upload to Image Host
- Upload images to Cloudinary, AWS S3, or similar
- Update the database with the new URLs

## 📝 Example Product URLs
Here are some example Takealot URLs you can use:

```javascript
const takealotProducts = [
  {
    name: 'iPhone 15 Pro Max',
    url: 'https://www.takealot.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-256gb-natural-titanium/PLID95234567',
    filename: 'iphone-15-pro-max.jpg'
  },
  {
    name: 'Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra', 
    url: 'https://www.takealot.com/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-256gb-titanium-gray/PLID95234568',
    filename: 'samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra.jpg'
  },
  // Add more products here
];
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Be respectful**: The script includes delays to avoid overwhelming Takealot's servers
- **Legal use**: Only download images for products you actually sell
- **Backup**: Keep copies of the images in case Takealot changes their URLs
- **Hotlinking**: Don't hotlink directly to Takealot images (they may block it)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Images not downloading?
